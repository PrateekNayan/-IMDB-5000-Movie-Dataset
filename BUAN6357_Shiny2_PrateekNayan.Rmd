Question 1: To know if movie location has an impact on the profitability of the movie, I tried to do a barplot of US Vs Non-US countries. If we observe the country column most of the countries are from US and hence it is easier to distinguish countries as US and Non-US. From the plot it can be inferred that ROI% is more for countries in USA than in Non-USA. Yes, Movie location has an impact on profitability. Seeing the ROI% being significantly more for USA, it is better if more movies are produced inside USA
```{r Tab2}
library(dplyr)

AD = data.frame(Actor = movie$actor_1_name, Director=movie$director_name,Profit= movie$profit, ROI =movie$ROI)

AD%>% group_by(AD$Actor,AD$Director)%>% summarise(c = (ROI))%>% arrange(desc(c))

```
Question 2: "Micah Sloat" and "Orean Peli" - Actor-Director combination delivered the most profitable movies during the time period covered in this dataset based on ROI%

```{r Tab3}
movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~title_year, y = ~imdb_score , mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~director_name, y = ~imdb_score , mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~movie_facebook_likes, y = ~imdb_score, mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~num_critic_for_reviews, y = ~imdb_score , mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~duration, y = ~imdb_score , mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~director_facebook_likes, y = ~imdb_score , mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~profit, y = ~imdb_score , mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~content_rating, y = ~imdb_score , mode = "markers", alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")
```
Question 3 : The following variables are seen to influence the IMDB score the most - Budget, Title_year, Duration, Gross.

Budget : It can be notied that as Budget increased, IMDB score has increased too.
Duration : If the duration of the movie was optimum like within 2 hrs, IMDB rating was found to be high. If the duration of the movie was long (>3 hours) IMDB rating was found to be slightly lower.
Title_Year : We can notice that all the movies were directed after the yeat 1990

```{r Tab4}
movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~movie_facebook_likes, y = ~budget, mode = "markers",alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~(actor_1_facebook_likes), y = ~(budget), mode = "markers",alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~(actor_2_facebook_likes), y = ~(budget), mode = "markers",alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

movie %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~(actor_3_facebook_likes), y = ~(budget), mode = "markers",alpha = 0.7, type = "scatter")

#Heatmap
ggcorr(movie[,c("movie_facebook_likes","actor_1_facebook_likes","actor_2_facebook_likes","actor_3_facebook_likes","budget")])

```

Question 4: To infer if Facebook likes for the movie and/or actors depend on the budget of the movie i used a heatmap. We can infer that there 0 or no corelation between these variables and budget.
